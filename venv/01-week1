Machine Learning

-- Arthur Samuel (1959  checkers program)
machine learning as the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly learned.

--Tom Mitchell ()
a well-posed learning problem is defined as follows. He says, a computer program is said to learn from experience E
with respect to some task T and some performance measure P,if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.

1963 vapnik support vector machine
  Machine learning Algorithm
   -->Supervised Learning (teach computer)
      right answer given
      regression (predict continues valued output)
      classification problem (Discrete valued output eg.(0,1))


   --> Unsupervised learning (computer learn by itself)
      goal is to find structure in it.
      clusering algorithm (eg. google news cluster same story to same link to avoid duplicacy)
      used to organise large computer cluster , social friend analysis , market segment in organisation (eg customer
      segmantation to determine which to sell), astronomical data analysis

 other : Reinforcement learning , Recommender system


 * Support vector machine -> mathmatic trick that allow computer to deal with infinite number of features

 ml consist of feature and label
  -feature like attribute or continuous data that make labels , label is some sort of prediction
  -simplify the data
  -build reln between attribute
  
A feature is a measurable property of the object youâ€™re trying to analyze. In datasets, features appear as columns:
